## Properties of an Image That Change Due to Watermarking

1. **Pixel Intensity Values**

   - **Description**: The pixel values are slightly modified to embed the watermark, especially in invisible watermarking.
   - **Detection**: These subtle changes can be detected by analyzing the distribution of pixel intensities or by comparing with an original image.

2. **Frequency Domain Coefficients**

   - **Description**: In frequency domain watermarking (e.g., DCT, DWT), the frequency coefficients are altered.
   - **Detection**: Changes in these coefficients can be detected using Fourier Transform or similar techniques, revealing the presence of a watermark.

3. **Spatial Domain Characteristics**

   - **Description**: Watermarks, especially visible ones, alter the spatial characteristics of an image, such as adding text or logos directly onto the pixel grid.
   - **Detection**: Visual inspection or pattern recognition algorithms can be used to detect these alterations.

4. **Statistical Properties**

   - **Description**: The introduction of a watermark can affect statistical measures like histograms, correlation, and noise levels in an image.
   - **Detection**: Statistical analysis can reveal anomalies that indicate the presence of a watermark.

5. **Compression Artifacts**

   - **Description**: Watermarked images, particularly when using robust watermarking techniques, might show increased susceptibility to compression artifacts (e.g., in JPEG).
   - **Detection**: Comparing the quality of compressed images can help in detecting watermarked images, as they may degrade differently than non-watermarked images.

6. **Edge and Texture Information**

   - **Description**: Watermarks can introduce new edges or alter existing textures within the image, particularly if the watermark is visible.
   - **Detection**: Edge detection algorithms or texture analysis can identify these changes.

7. **Color and Contrast**

   - **Description**: Visible watermarks often change the color and contrast in the regions they cover.
   - **Detection**: Analyzing the color channels and contrast distribution can help distinguish watermarked regions.

8. **Noise Levels**

   - **Description**: Some watermarking techniques introduce additional noise to the image, particularly in fragile watermarking.
   - **Detection**: Noise analysis can help detect watermarks by identifying regions with abnormal noise levels.

9. **Structural Similarity Index (SSIM)**

   - **Description**: Watermarking can affect the structural similarity between the watermarked and original image.
   - **Detection**: SSIM can be used to compare the watermarked image with the original or a non-watermarked reference.

10. **Perceptual Quality**
    - **Description**: The overall perceptual quality of the image may change, especially if the watermark is not imperceptible.
    - **Detection**: Human visual inspection or automated perceptual quality metrics can identify such changes.
